- IssueID = PP13-27
- Please read 'Prompts/BasePrompt.md' first for general context
- Please review the  report on 'PP13-23' in the 'chroma-feat-design-planning-mcp' issue database, this issue is a continuation
- When attempting to use the multidolt MCP server in another project the server initializes correctly, but whenever I make a toolcall that requires Python (loaded via Python.net) the requests gets stuck at starting the python environment and/or requesting data from the python environment - when I then cancel the request from within the MCP consumer (e.g. cancel the tool handle) - loading and running the python request continues and succeeds - is it possible somehow the request (thread) locks creation of the python environment? Please deeply investigate this issue, and report me the likely cause of this issue - please don't yet change any code
	- See below for a timed application log (when logging is enabled) - note that we mad a request at 2025-12-11 09:31:44.955, it found the python DLL at 2025-12-11 09:30:41.610; then it got locked - after cancelling the request at 2025-12-11 09:31:44.955 it continued with the required actions which completed succesfully 2025-12-11 09:31:47.023
