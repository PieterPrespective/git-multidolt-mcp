- IssueID = PP13-40
- Please read 'Prompts/BasePrompt.md' first for general context
- In this assignment we'll want to update/implement all user facing MCP tools (i.e. tools available to the consuming LLM) 
- For context please read 
	- Specification for all required tools, and signatures - 'Documentation\tdd\251216_MCP_Tools_Specification.md'
	- User documentation outline for said tools - 'Documentation\tdd\251216_UserDocumentationOutline.md'
	- Optionally, the full interface plan - 'Documentation\tdd\251216_Dolt_Interface_Implementation_Plan_v3.md'
		- Note that this is a long document (5817 lines); if you want to read it please do it in chunks
- Please implement the tools in accordance with the correct MCP tool format; note that some tools may already exists - if they are still required, please update them - if not - please leave the tool in, but remove the [McpServerToolType] class attribute
	- Please leave the GetServerVersionTool in
	- As an example tool structure see 'multidolt-mcp\Tools\ChromaListCollectionsTool.cs'
	- Please put all tools in the folder multidolt-mcp\Tools
	- If the functions required to run the tool are not yet implemented within the project - please make a stub for the tool, but do not yet implement the backend code - rather report to me at the end of this assignment what backend/interfacing functions still need to be implemented
- Please create a test with a flow duplicate to 'ChromaDoltSyncIntegrationTestsV2' - however, instead of calling the backend functions directly - use the user facing tools : 
	- use JSON objects as input, and validate the toolcalls return a proper output JSON
	- The Entire flow should be possible with the tools above, if tools are missing please let me know
	- If tools are NOT USED in this test - please let me know - feel free to design an additional E2E test with a flow to validate the functioning of these tools, or extend the flow of the duplicate test to include them
