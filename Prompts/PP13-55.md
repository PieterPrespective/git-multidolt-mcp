- IssueID = PP13-55
- Please read 'Prompts/BasePrompt.md' first for general context
- Test `Issue5_PushOperationAfterFallback_ShouldFindConfiguredRemote` is failing due to timeout caused by collection conflict errors during ChromaDB operations. The test currently uses remote clone approach which pre-populates ChromaDB, then attempts to create the same collection again, causing "Collection already exists" error that leads to Python.NET hang.
- For context please read:
	- The successful PP13-54 implementation which resolved Issue4 test using local repository approach
	- Test failure analysis in 'TestResources/Issue5_PushOperationAfterFallback_ShouldFindConfiguredRemote-639019953939252749.testlog'
	- The root cause analysis shows the test hangs at line 335 after "Collection testCollection already exists" error
- In this activity specifically focus on applying the proven local repository solution from Issue4 to resolve Issue5 test timeout:
	- Apply the same local repository initialization approach used successfully in Issue4 to Issue5 test
	- Replace the remote clone operation with local repository setup to ensure clean ChromaDB state
	- Implement the same schema creation and sync state initialization methods used in Issue4
	- Ensure the test validates push operations after fallback in an isolated, repeatable environment
	- The test should maintain its original intent (testing push operations after fallback) while eliminating the collection conflict root cause
- The success criteria:
	- Issue5 test passes consistently without timeout
	- Test execution time should be similar to Issue4 (12-15 seconds)
	- Perfect test isolation with no external dependencies
	- Validates actual push operation functionality in clean environment
	- Maintains the test's original purpose of validating push operations after empty repository fallback
