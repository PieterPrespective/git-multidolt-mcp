- IssueID = PP13-33
- Please read 'Prompts/BasePrompt.md' first for general context
- please read the document 'Documentation/tdd/Dolt_Interface_Implementation_Plan.md'
		- Note this is a long document (3055 lines) - but reading it fully is important for your context - so please read it in segments - if thats too hard, let me know so I can segment it in readable chunks
- In this activity we'll be implementing and testing step 1.3 from Chapter 6 - this is basically the delta detector from section 4.2
	- Please read chapter 4 in its entirety : Setup utilities to manage the specific schemas in this chapter, but take into account that the schemas can change/extend so work with interfaces
	- Please implement integration tests to validate functioning of the delta detector from both the chroma and dolt
